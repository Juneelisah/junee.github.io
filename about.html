        <p>
          Welcome to our podcast Tune with lune! We are June and Loïs and we are
          the creators of Tune with lune. We created this podcast because we
          both love music and wanted to share this with the world. We appreciate
          all kinds of music from classical to heavy metal, so naturally we will
          discuss various genres in our episodes and introduce you to
          underground subgenres. We offer fresh-takes, artist interviews, and
          in-depth reviews. Our goal is to inform our listeners about music and
          the history of it. We also want to introduce and motivate you to
          listen to genres you normally would not listen to.

          Hi! I’m Lois, and I’m excited to be one of the voices behind our
          podcast! Music is my passion, and I love chatting about everything
          from big hits to hidden gems. I believe every song has a story to
          tell, and I’m here to help uncover those stories while having a blast.
          When I’m not podcasting, I’m usually digging through vinyl or hanging
          out with friends at local gigs. Let’s celebrate the music we love and
          discover some new favorites along the way!

          Hey there! I’m June, a music lover and the creative mind behind this
          podcast. I’m all about discovering new tunes and sharing the stories
          that make them special. Whether it’s a catchy indie track or a classic
          jam, I love diving into the vibes and emotions behind the music. When
          I’m not recording, you’ll probably find me jamming out at a concert or
          curating my next favorite playlist.
